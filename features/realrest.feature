Feature: As a system owner
  In order to display real data to my visitors and for users to start ordering via phone or email
  I would like to have real restaurant info in the system

Scenario:
  Given I visit the landing page
  Then I should see Restaurant "Goteborg Wok Sushi"
  And I should see "Address: Ã–strahamngatan 5"
  And I should see "Email: goteborgwok@live.se"
  And I should see "Phone: 031-13 51 52"
